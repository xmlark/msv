/**
 * Primitive of the tree regular expression.

 * most of the derived class is immutable (except ReferenceExp, ElementExp and OtherExp).
 *
 * <p>
 * By making it immutable, it becomes possible to share subexpressions among expressions.
 * This is very important for regular-expression-derivation based validation algorithm,
 * as well as for smaller memory footprint.
 * This sharing is automatically achieved by ExpressionPool.
 *
 * <p>
 * ReferebceExp, ElementExp, and OtherExp are also placed in the pool,
 * but these are not unified. Since they are not unified,
 * application can derive classes from these expressions
 * and mix them into AGM. This technique is heavily used to introduce schema language
 * specific primitives into AGM. See various sub-packages of this package for examples.
 *
 * <p>
 * The equals method must be implemented by the derived type. equals method will be
 * used to unify the expressions. equals method can safely assume that its children
 * are already unified (therefore == can be used to test the equality, rather than
 * equals method).
 *
 * <p>
 * To achieve unification, we overload the equals method so that
 * <code>o1.equals(o2)</code> is true if o1 and o2 are identical.
 * There, those two objects must return the same hash code. For this purpose,
 * the hash code is calculated statically and cached internally.
