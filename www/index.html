	The Sun Multi-Schema XML Validator (MSV) is a Java technology tool to validate XML documents against several kinds of XML schemata. It supports RELAX NG, RELAX Namespace, RELAX Core, TREX, XML DTDs, and a subset of XML Schema Part 1. This latest (version 1.2) release includes several bug fixes and adds better conformance to RELAX NG/W3C XML standards and JAXP masquerading. This download package includes binaries, source code, and detailed documentation.
<p>
	This tool is:
<ul>
	<li>
		A command line tool that can read XML documents and validate them against a schema (DTD/RELAX/TREX/W3C). If an error is found, error messages are provided.
	<li>
		A library that can be incorporated into Java applications as a validator.
</ul>
<p>
	See the included commandline.html file for details on how to use MSV from the command line. See the included developer.html file for details on how to use it as a library.
